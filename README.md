Planks exercise timing app

## Work In Progress!!
There are still a fair bit of the original boilerplate things in the project, even though they are no longer used. 

And I'm embarassed by the lack of tests.  Coming soon...

Based on [react-mobx-boilerplate](https://github.com/osenvosem/react-mobx-boilerplate)

Mostly this is a learning project for building Progressive Web Apps
